1. The **"Add Product" page is currently not working** — I want it to function properly. I need to be able to add new products, input product details, record product information, and create new tasks.  

2. I want to **manually add and delete game names**. Once added, I should be able to select previously entered game names from a dropdown when adding a product. It should also be searchable.  

3. My products include **game accounts and in-game items**, and I want an option to select the **month (Month 1, Month 2, etc.)**. It should support going back to view previous months. Once a month passes, it should **automatically start a new month**. For example, when it transitions from Month 1 to Month 2, I should **not be able to edit** data in Month 1, only view details like profits, accounts, and items. However, I should be able to **clear all data in Month 1** to free up space.  

4. In the **Users system**, I want user data to be editable, including the ability to delete a user account, **reset passwords**, and see online status like how many days, minutes, and seconds a user has been online or inactive.  

5. In the **registration system**, users should **not be able to choose their rank**. All newly registered users will automatically receive the **"New User" rank** and will **not have access to system settings or the backend**. Only Admin and Supervisor roles should have full access.  

6. The **product system should be rebuilt** so that accounts and items are separated clearly. For example, game accounts and in-game items should be separated for each month — Month 1, Month 2, etc. The system should **automatically create new months** by counting down time. When a new month starts, it should **separate the new records** from old ones. The new records replace the current display, and the old ones go into the history (e.g., Month 1, Month 2 in order).  

7. Please **check everything in detail**. Any feature or function that is currently not working must be fixed. Every system on the website must work correctly. Also, **if there are any essential systems I didn’t mention, you must add them yourself**. Thank you very much.
